## Challenge Overview

The grades of the ninth graders at Thomas High School have been changed. While administrators do not know the full extent of this academic dishonesty, they want to uphold the standards of state testing. After assessing the situation with the school superintendent and Maria, the best approach prosed is to:

1. Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School with NaN.
2. Keep all other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School intact.
3. Explain how PyCitySchools analysis changes after handling the incorrect data.
